Set 10

The source code for the AbstractGrid class is in Appendix D.

1. Where is the isValid method specified? Which classes provide an implementation of this method?

Don't know what "specified" means... It is declared in Grid and implemented in BoundedGrid and UnboundedGrid.

2. Which AbstractGrid methods call the isValid method? Why don't the other methods need to call it?

getValidAdjacentLocations. because the other methods call getValidAdjacentLocations.

3. Which methods of the Grid interface are called in the getNeighbors method? Which classes provide implementations of these methods?




4. Why must the get method, which returns an object of type E, be used in the getEmptyAdjacentLocations method when this method returns locations, not objects of type E?
5. What would be the effect of replacing the constant Location.HALF_RIGHT with Location.RIGHT in the two places where it occurs in the getValidAdjacentLocations method?
